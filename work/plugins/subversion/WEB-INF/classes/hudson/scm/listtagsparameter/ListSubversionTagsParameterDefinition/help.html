<div>
  When used, this parameter will display a field at build-time so that the user
  is able to select a Subversion tag from which to create the working copy for
  this project.<br/>
  Once the two fields <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Repository URL</strong>
  are set, you must (1) ensure the job uses <strong>Subversion</strong> and (2)
  set the <strong>Repository URL</strong> field of <strong>Subversion</strong>
  by concatenating the two fields of this parameter. For instance, if <strong>
  Name</strong> is set to <code>SVN_TAG</code> and <strong>Repository URL
  </strong> is set to <code>https://hudson.dev.java.net/svn/hudson/tags</code>,
  then <strong>Subversion</strong>'s <strong>Repository URL</strong> must be set
  to <code>https://hudson.dev.java.net/svn/hudson/tags/$SVN_TAG</code>.
