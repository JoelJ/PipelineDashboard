<div>
	This is the regular expression group number to be displayed as the value in the first column of the view.
	For example in the given regular expression <tt>(Hello) (\w+)</tt>, if 0 is given as this value then the first
	column for the row will display "Hello {MATCHED TEXT}". If 1 is given as this value then the first column for the
	row will display "Hello". Or if 2 then "{MATCHED TEXT}" will be displayed.
	<br/><br/>
	The value of the given group is also used to determine uniqueness for different rows. For example, if the given
	regex is <tt>(\d+) (\w+)</tt> and this group value is 1 then there will be a new row in the view for every build
	description that has the same number. Whereas if a 2 is provided, then there will be a new row created in the view
	for every build description that has the same series of word characters. If a 0 is provided, then a new row will be
	created for every build description that has the same number <b>and</b> the same series of word characters.
