  If set, Jenkins will run CVS with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=CVS_RSH">the <tt>CVS_RSH</tt> environment variable</a> set
  to this value. If this value is not set, and the web container that Jenkins runs in
  has <tt>CVS_RSH</tt> set in its environment variable, then CVS will inherit it.
